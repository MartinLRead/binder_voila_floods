# binder_voila_floods
Demo of using Binder and Voila to display analysis of floods data

To display the Jupyter Notebook as a locally hosted webpage using Voila, first ensure that voila and ipywidgets are installed
in your environment:
pip install voila ipywidgets
The command line instruction to launch the notebook using Voila is: 'voila voila_demo5.ipynb'

To display the notebook using Binder, the steps are:
1) Ensure the file is in a public GitHub repository that contains a 'requirements' file listing dependencies;
2) Go to Binder and enter the parent URL of the GitHub repository (https://github.com/MartinLRead/binder_voila_floods) and the ipynb file name (voila_demo5.ipynb), then select 'Launch'.
